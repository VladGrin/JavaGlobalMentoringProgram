Core ideas:
    immutable
    A time is a time, a date is a date. Not always both (like java.util.Date)
    Not everyone uses the same calendar (the same Chronologyn)

LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime -> Local, no time zone
OffsetDateTime, OffsetTime -> Time with an offset from Greenwich
ZonedDateTime -> LocalDateTime with a time zone
Duration, Period -> Time span
Instant -> Timestamp
Formatting -> Easy and thread-safe formatting
